This is my version of a course project for "Advanced CSS and SASS" course originally designed by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Here are some improvements I made to the codebase and the design:

## Typography & layout

- Muli instead of Lato: I found its stroke width more consistent in all-caps titles, and its lower x-height looks more casual;
- New h2 hover animation: the original one seemed too extreme, so I came up with a subtler "shake" and gradient displacement;
- Buttons: on

## Code
